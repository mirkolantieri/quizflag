# Quiz Flag App

Quiz Flag App is an Android application written in Kotlin and with the best practices 
from Android v.12 and Jetpack libraries. The app simulates a small quiz where the
user/participant should find, whenever it appears, to which country does belong the flag.

There are 7 questions in total, which for lecturing purposes, these last are hardcoded
into a simple ArrayList of Question data model, whereas the options and the correct answer
are bound to the view.
